# Neural collapse in CNN-1D

Laboratory repository for the Quantitative Evaluation of Neural Networks, focused on Neural Collapse, designed to emulate the following article:

The objective of this project is not merely to observe Neural Collapse but to explore its emergence through ablation studies and layer-wise analysis. 
By varying optimization methods and training regimes, we investigate which components of the learning dynamics are necessary and sufficient for the Neural Collaps regime to appear and how it progressiely forms across network layers.

This project enables controlled experiments to answer:

- *Which layers collapse first?*
- *Is ETF geometry present in early representations or only at the penultimate layer?*
- *How do different optimizers alter the collapse dynamics?*

All experiments use a fixed **CNN-1D** architecture specifically designed to expose a **high-dimensional penultimate feature space** where Neural Collapse can be measured.

 ## 🧪 Experiment 1 — Baseline Neural Collapse with SGD

As a first experiment, we reproduce the **canonical Neural Collapse setting** described by Papyan et al. (2020) by training a **CNN-1D on MNIST-1D using standard SGD** for a sufficiently long horizon (200 epochs).
The goal of this experiment is to establish a **reference collapse trajectory** in which:
- training reaches the **interpolation regime**,
- the **Training Phase Transition (TPT)** is crossed,
- and the network converges toward the **Neural Collapse fixed point**.

During training we track the four core Neural Collapse metrics:


| Metric | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| **NC1** | Within-class feature collapse |
| **NC2** | ETF structure of class means |
| **NC3** | Duality between classifier weights and class centroids |
| **NC4** | Nearest Class Center optimality |

The dashed vertical line marks the **TPT**, after which training accuracy saturates and the loss enters a low-noise regime.  
This phase transition is where Neural Collapse is theoretically expected to begin.

The four Neural Collapse conditions are measured during training:
All metrics converge after the TPT, confirming that the network enters the **Neural Collapse regime** predicted by theory.

## 🧪 Experiment 2 — Layer-wise Emergence of Neural Collapse

Neural Collapse is formally defined at the **penultimate layer**, where the cross-entropy loss directly enforces class separation and margin maximization.  
For this reason, the theory does not require earlier layers to satisfy Neural Collapse conditions.
Our layer-wise analysis reveals that:
- early convolutional layers do **not** exhibit strong within-class collapse or ETF geometry,
- intermediate layers progressively approach the Neural Collapse regime,
- the penultimate layer fully satisfies all NC conditions.
